# Profile

Liam Stoica is a Growth Designer from New Zealand (with Romanian roots) now living in New York. He designs products that feel human, intentional, and simple — the kind people use and think, “Oh, finally.”

He loves the intersection of creativity, systems, and business. It’s where he does his best work: simplifying the complicated, connecting the dots, and making products actually make sense.

Before design, Liam lived a whole other life in tennis — representing New Zealand, competing around the world, and coaching at the Rafa Nadal Academy. He even has a classic recruiting video from back in the day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBrOqA3kYOc

It explains a lot about his competitive edge, calm mindset, and ability to not crumble under pressure.

Outside of work, he cooks, paints, travels, and reads way too much history for someone who isn’t a historian. He brings warmth, curiosity, and very Kiwi energy (fun, outgoing, slightly cheeky) into everything he does.
