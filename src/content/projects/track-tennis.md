# Track.Tennis

A strategic redesign of Track.Tennis’ brand, product, and business model—shifting from a consumer tennis tool to a scalable, multi-sport B2B ecosystem for competitive racket sports.

## Overview
Track.Tennis initially tried to serve all types of players (casual, junior, competitive), resulting in a diluted experience and cumbersome setup. As both a competitive tennis player and coach, I saw the deeper opportunity: focus on the competitive layer where performance, clarity, and reliability matter most. That insight guided a complete repositioning of the product and brand, expanding the platform to include padel and pickleball and shifting to a cloud-based B2B model that aligned with how facilities actually operate.

## Key Responsibilities
• Led product strategy, UX/UI design, research, and user segmentation  
• Defined the pivot to a competitive-player focus  
• Designed early app screens, then transitioned to a web-based ecosystem  
• Created the visual identity system and modern brand direction  
• Mapped player, coach, facility, and tournament workflows  
• Designed scalable features for multi-sport expansion  
• Guided messaging, positioning, and value propositions for each user segment  

## Strategy
Three strategic pillars shaped the new direction:

1. **Focus on Competitive Players**  
The highest-value segment needed fast, reliable recording and deep analysis—not manual setup or mobile friction.

2. **Shift to a Cloud-Based B2B Model**  
Facilities, clubs, and colleges could manage recordings, monetization, and branding more easily from a streamlined web platform.

3. **Expand Beyond Tennis**  
Padel and pickleball were rapidly growing and required the same camera infrastructure, opening a new market without reinventing the product.

## Challenges
• Proving the strategic pivot required research and market validation  
• Moving from mobile to web demanded rethinking flows, storage, and player journeys  
• Rebranding from orange to green required reshaping the product’s psychology and positioning  
• Convincing stakeholders to narrow the audience before widening the offering  

## Outcomes
• A unified web ecosystem for recording, storing, analyzing, and sharing matches  
• Modern brand and design system applied across product and marketing  
• Expansion path for multiple racket sports  
• Clearer target market and stronger product–market alignment  
• 1500+ cameras installed, 40k+ users, 8k+ events streamed, 90+ college programs  

## Key Learnings
Experience gives intuition, but data creates conviction. My tennis background helped shape early direction, but validating personas and proving the B2B opportunity was essential before redesigning the product.
