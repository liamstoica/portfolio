# Hard Rock Web

A unified global web ecosystem for 30+ Hard Rock properties across hotels, casinos, cafes, and entertainment.

## Overview
Hard Rock’s digital presence had grown into 30+ fragmented legacy sites, each with its own IA, content rules, and visual language. Ahead of the 2027 Las Vegas flagship launch, the company needed one modern, scalable platform that could carry the full brand experience and convert across multiple lines of business.

Liam led UX/UI design and contributed to digital transformation strategy within the Hard Rock Experience (HRX) innovation team.

## Key Responsibilities
• Defined the multi-property IA, navigation model, and cross-LOB user journeys  
• Designed the unified web ecosystem and modular component system  
• Created strategies connecting booking, dining, shows, and gaming into one flow  
• Partnered with 30+ stakeholders across properties and departments  
• Translated business requirements into scalable UX patterns  
• Established the foundational design system for future web + app convergence  

## Strategy
The approach centered on three pillars:
1. **Architecture & Navigation** — A global quick-tab nav, revamped mega menu, unified URL schema, and a location switcher enabling instant property switching without restarting the journey.
2. **Experience Design** — Replaced text-heavy pages with dynamic maps, sticky action bars, authentic social proof, and image-first modules to increase clarity and conversion.
3. **Systemization & Scalability** — A tokenized design system, modular component library, and CMS-flexible framework allowing properties to stay unique while maintaining global consistency.

## Challenges
• Misaligned stakeholder priorities across resorts, cafes, casinos, and entertainment  
• A partially complete Sitecore-to-AEM migration with shifting technical constraints  
• Organizational tension around redesign vs. migration  
• Lack of consistent analytics to inform decisions  

Liam’s team built alignment, created shared language, and established strategic clarity.

## Outcomes
• 100M+ annual visits moved onto one unified experience  
• 30+ property sites aligned under one design system  
• 3× projected increase in Hard Rock experiences per customer  
• +22% projected lift in direct bookings  
• A scalable ecosystem supporting future launches, including Las Vegas 2027  

## Key Learnings
Scaling design inside a global brand is as much about people as product. Building trust, aligning incentives, and navigating ambiguity were essential to moving the work forward.
