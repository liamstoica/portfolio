# Hard Rock Experience App

A unified lifestyle app connecting Hard Rock’s loyalty, hospitality, retail, and entertainment into one cross-platform ecosystem.

## Overview
The Hard Rock Experience (HRX) app reimagines loyalty from a casino-centric program into a lifestyle membership that connects hotels, cafes, concerts, gaming, and retail. The goal was to unify multiple business lines and create an experience that works for every type of Hard Rock guest ahead of the 2027 Las Vegas flagship opening.

Liam supported UX and UI design across the app, contributing to core features, flows, and the system design that ties the app and website together.

## Key Responsibilities
• Designed and refined core app journeys across Experiences, Offers, Moments, and property-level flows  
• Ensured cross-platform cohesion between the new website and app ecosystem  
• Worked with multiple lines of business to align requirements across casinos, hotels, cafes, and entertainment  
• Contributed to the evolving HRX design system and interaction language  
• Helped prototype and validate key features with customers and stakeholders  
• Balanced global consistency with local property flexibility  

## Strategy
The team approached the redesign through three guiding principles:

1. **Experience-First Loyalty**  
Shift loyalty from transactional status updates to a lifestyle ecosystem connecting stays, dining, shows, and play.

2. **Unified Discovery**  
Design a cross-property navigation model and content architecture that gives every guest a shared entry point — regardless of whether they start with a show, a hotel, or the casino.

3. **Scalable System**  
Create one modular design system, enabling 30+ properties to plug into the same platform while maintaining local differentiation through content and offers.

## Challenges
• Every line of business had different systems, incentives, and definitions of value  
• The original Unity app only supported casino players, limiting the behavioral model  
• Properties operated like independent companies, each with unique needs and flows  
• Stakeholder alignment across global teams was slow and complex  
• Early development constraints shaped which features could be delivered first  

## Outcomes
• A cohesive loyalty and experience ecosystem  
• 30+ global properties integrating into the platform  
• 5 lines of business unified under one design system  
• 45% higher engagement compared to prior Unity app tests  
• Foundation ready for phased launch leading into Las Vegas 2027  

## Key Learnings
Designing loyalty at global scale requires harmonizing identity, incentives, and expectations across very different worlds. Earlier stakeholder alignment and shared testing rituals would have accelerated clarity and buy-in.
